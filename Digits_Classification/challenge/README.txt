This is the challenge dataset for digit classification.
The data is contained in the MATLAB file "cdigits.mat" (or "cdigits_*.txt" for non-MATLAB users).  The file contains the following data:
  - cdigits_vec    [784 x 50] - 50 challenge digits, in the same format as the provided MNIST data.
  - cdigits_labels [1 x 50]   - true labels (0-9)
  - cdigits_eg.png            - example montage of the digits
  
Test your trained classifier on the challenge digits.  You should use the same classifier that you used on the MNIST test data.  That is, do not retrain your classifier, and do not change any parameters from what was used on the test set.  Record the accuracy on the challenge digits for the trained classifier from each trial.  As a reference, the average accuracy for the NN classifier on the challenge digits is 0.3500.

Email me the following experimental results:
  1. accuracy on the MNIST test set for each experiment trial
  2. accuracy on the challenge digits for the trained classifier from each experiment trial

In your presentation, do not report your accuracy on the challenge digits.  I'll do it at the end of the session.  It is okay to report your accuracy on the test set.
